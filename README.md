Background
==========

This project a reimplementation of CLICAL. The original CLICAL was created in
Helsinki University of Technology in 1987. From the [original documentation][original]:

> CLICAL is a stand-alone calculator-type computer program for geometric
> algebras of multivectors, called Clifford algebras. CLICAL evaluates
> elementary functions with arguments in complex numbers, and their
> generalizations: quaternions, octonions and multivectors in Clifford
> algebras. CLICAL works directly on intrinsic geometric objects:
> lines, planes and volumes, represented by vectors, bivectors and
> multivectors. Oriented volume elementes, or segments of subspaces,
> are represented by simple multivectors, which are homogeneous and
> decomposable elements in the exterior algebra. CLICAL works on
> Clifford algebras _Cl_<sub>p,q</sub> of real non-degenerate quadratic spaces
> **R**<sup>p,q</sup>.

> Clifford algebras are used to handle rotations and oriented
> subspaces. Clifford algebra is a user interface, which provides
> geometrical insight. However, the actual numerical computations are
> faster in matrix images of Clifford algebras. CLICAL computer program
> was developed to enable input-output in Clifford algebras (and fast
> internal computation in matrices).

> CLICAL is intended for researchers and teachers of Clifford algebras
> and spinors.

Why re-implement it?
====================

I think Geometric Algebras and Clifford Algebras are the neatest way of
explaining many physical phenomena. For example, replacing the concept of
the axis of rotation with a _plane_ of rotation gives you information about
the orientation of rotation. This means that even when you switch from
right-handed coordinate system to a left-handed system, there will be no unphysical axis reversal.

This project is my attempt at bringing geometric algebra to a wider audience.
CLICAL had a pleasant syntax, but running it in a modern computer can be a bit
underwhelming. On the Web it can be used from anywhere on the world. Also the
output can be a lot prettier. To emphasize the last point, here's a quote from
the _GUIDE_ file distributed with the original:

> If you have a color monitor and a color card, you can write colored files.

Indeed I have a color monitor!

Goals
=====

The primary goal is to provide an easily accessible tool for people not familiar with
Cliffor algebras. Specifically, performance is a bit of a non-concern. It is for exploration,
for toying and for 

For "production use," whatever that may mean, this is probably not a good tool.
Consider other tools, such as:

- [GluCat][glucat]
- [SymPy][sympy]

[sympy]: http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.0/modules/galgebra/GA/GAsympy.html

Current status
==============

It can do sums! That's end-to-end functionality from input to output. This means we are
at version 0.0.1. See it in action at http://arsatiki.github.com/clical.js/

(Try 1 + 2e1 or e1 + e12 + e21 or whatever.)

For more detailed future plans, see the Github issues list and the file CONTRIBUTING.md.



Other information
=================

Target environment is HTML5 compatible browser.

Some initial prototyping is done with Python.
